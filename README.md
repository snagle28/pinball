# pinball

I wanted to make a creative, food-themed pinball game based on a charcuterie board. I was inspired by various items, like cheese, honey, grapes, melon, and more. It was my hope that I could rely on the unique characterstic of each item (crumbly cheese, juicy grapes, sticky honey) to make simple mechanics that felt aligned with the theme. I learned how to create physics effects, particle systems, and custom colliders. I think I suceeded at implementing the theme and creating unique obstacles; specfically, I found the grapes to be the most exciting obstacle to make. I think that my art was a nice addition, but wish I had more time to streamline the scale and resolution and implement designs for the flippers/direction triggers. I also wish I had more time to balance the game, as I think that it can be a bit difficult at times.
